Project Descriptions:

Project 1:

Create a slightly more advanced version of the classic “Hello World” program. Besides the main function, a separate function should handle printing out the message “Hello World” to the command line or IDE’s output.

Project 2:

Create a command line program that reads 20 integers from a text file and stores them in an array. The array needs to be designed to hold 20 integers. The supplied text file (project_02_data.txt) will contain exactly 20 integers - your program does not need to deal with invalid input. Your program then should process the array using three separate functions to find the average, highest, and lowest values. Finally, the result of the calculations should be displayed to the command line.
