# Project Descriptions:

## Project 1:

Create a slightly more advanced version of the classic “Hello World” program. Besides the main function, a separate function should handle printing out the message “Hello World” to the command line or IDE’s output.

## Project 2:

Create a command line program that reads 20 integers from a text file and stores them in an array. The array needs to be designed to hold 20 integers. The supplied text file (project_02_data.txt) will contain exactly 20 integers - your program does not need to deal with invalid input. Your program then should process the array using three separate functions to find the average, highest, and lowest values. Finally, the result of the calculations should be displayed to the command line.

## Project 3:

Create a command line program that reads datafrom atext file into an array of structs.For this program you are notusing pointers so you will address the structs properties with the “.” Syntax. The array should be designed to hold a maximum of 64 records.The supplied text file will contain a String(name), a float(price), and an integer(number). This is the format of the data. After the array has been populated,process thearray and calculate the total value of the items in stock (price * number). Finallycalculate the total value of all items in stock–the total of allthe values.

## Project 4:

1.Create an empty linked list that holds numbers

2.Print the (empty) list

3.Open the supplied file and read the numbers

4.Push each of these numbers onto the list

5.Print the list

6.Pop each number off of the list–printing the number as it is removed

7.Print the list (hopefully empty)

8.Close and reopen the file

9.Read the file again

10.Enqueue the numbers onto the list

11.Print the list

12.Dequeue each number off of the list – printing each number as it is removed

13.Print the list(hopefully empty)
